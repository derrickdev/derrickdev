### üìö My Unconventional Path

My educational journey started with a focus on Bilingual Translation at university. While delving into languages and cultures, I realized a deep-seated passion for technology. This discovery sparked a new trajectory.

üåê **From Human Languages to Coding Languages:** I transitioned from translating words to crafting code. Starting with HTML and CSS, I dipped my toes into the vast world of web development. It was a leap into the unknown, but I was fueled by my unwavering curiosity and determination.

üë®‚Äçüíª **Finding My Tribe:** I was fortunate to connect with a friendly and supportive community of developers. They became my guiding stars on this journey, helping me understand the intricacies of web development and coding. Their mentorship gave me the confidence to keep going.

‚öôÔ∏è **JavaScript - My Big Challenge:** JavaScript quickly became my next big challenge. It was a language that required patience and practice. After three years of self-learning and hands-on experience, I had mastered the art of making websites come to life with JavaScript.

üíº **Freelancing Adventures:** With my skills steadily growing, I embarked on a freelancing journey. I had the opportunity to work on diverse and exciting projects, each one a unique puzzle to solve.

üåê **Community Building:** To give back to the community and keep learning, I actively participated in developer communities on social media. Sharing my knowledge with others and gaining insights from fellow developers has been a rewarding experience.

### üöÄ Continuous Learning

üéì **Full Stack Bootcamp:** In 2021, I completed a Full Stack Web Developer Bootcamp on [UDEMY](udemy.com). The bootcamp sharpened my skills in **HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, Express.js, React, and MongoDB**. It was an intensive and enriching experience that pushed me to new heights.

üîß **WordPress Expertise:** Simultaneously, I dived into the Advanced WordPress Bootcamp at **Digital Valley** **[EPITECH](https://epitech.bj/)** in November 2022. It was a significant chapter in my journey, equipping me with valuable expertise  in creating user friendly interfaces , web design , Project management .

üß† **Software Engineering Journey:** May 2023 marked the beginning of my Software Engineering Backend Java Pathway powered by **[SOURCEMIND](https://sourcemind.com/)** AND **[WEBB FONTAINE](https://webbfontaine.com/)**. This comprehensive program encompassed **front-end development, computer science, advanced DevOps with Linux, Nginx, Docker, Git, and a deep dive into Java. Topics like Design Patterns, Solid Principles, Spring, and Spring Boot** were part of my daily explorations, complemented by **real-world projects** that put theory into practice.
